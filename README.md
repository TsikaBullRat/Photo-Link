# Hacking tester 1
### Ntsikayomzi Phenyo Ngcakani

Let it be know this is not for the intention of actually hacking but my own personal practice of such
concepts

## Notes:
-   Where do we start:
        navigator object

-   So this went from being about checking out hacking concepts, to trying to fuck around with Node.js
    The next test run will be based on building a server with Node.js, this being a social media 
    platform to look at:
    -   Login/Register HTTP request
    -   FTP based module
    -   Seperate HTTP module
    -   File structure
    -   Database design/build(slightly tricky, maybe I'll try MongoDB)

-       Thats all I shall call it.
